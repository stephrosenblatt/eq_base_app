## Equisolve Application Developer - Code Assessment - February 2021

### Overview
This app us using Ruby version 2.6.3 and Rails 6.1.2.1.

Please use Ruby on Rails and RSpec to complete the following:

You are working within a content management system used to build a website. The team is looking for a tool to easily build a website by importing a CSV of all of the pages that should be on the website and their relative paths.

Each row in the CSV is a web page’s title and relative path on the website.

The CSV is provided. We are looking for you to create a basic interface that allows these users to upload a CSV in the provided structure, and the system will:
* Parse the CSV and organize the CSV rows into a nested page structure
* Display the created nested page structure (this can be on the same page as the form, right above or below it)

### FAQ
* You do NOT need to store the uploaded csv
* You do not need to store any upload history; uploading a second CSV overwrites the current displayed nested page structure
* You only need one view (an `index` view in the controller) for this assessment. You do not need edit/show/etc views.
* Anything you want us to know, please add it to this README below the instructions under `Developer Notes`

This test is meant to see how you approach issues and structure / write code; this isn’t about coding the feature to perfection.

### Tests
Write the test coverage the way you would for a real app. Any tests you would add but did not add, please add to this README under `Developer Notes`.

### Delivery
Push the code to a Github repo and invite stephrosenblatt and ericmason to the repository. Please add any relevant information to the README, and let Stephanie Serafine know approximately how long you spent on it. It’s more informational and there is no “required” amount of time, but we aim for you to spend 1-3 hours on it.
